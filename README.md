A ready-to-use CI/CD Pipeline for managing your infrastructure with [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/).

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the following command in your project:

```bash
fluentci run terragrunt_pipeline
```

Or, if you want to use it as a template:

```bash
fluentci init -t terragrunt
```

This will create a `.fluentci` folder in your project.

Now you can run the pipeline with:

```bash
fluentci run .
```
